<h2>About the project</h2>


<p><b>SweetCor</b> is a Full-Stack Blog Application Boilerplate developed using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, and MongoDB.

 The application is designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, allowing users to create an account and write simple blog posts. However, only the admin has the authority to approve posts to be visible on the blog. Additionally, the admin can update the featured post of the blog. 

The application has the potential for significant enhancements, including support for rich text, multiple images, and integration with a CMS. 
Currently the blog content text is just for presentation purposes and uses <em>dangerouslySetInnerHTML</em> which is not recommended (can lead to security vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)).
